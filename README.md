This project is intended as a clone for the following app: https://cyberpolicy.com/cyber-assessment

Here's what I used to build my clone.

React.js to build the application itself
ReactRouter for routing
Redux using the ducks pattern for state management (Erik mentioned that you use it at CoverHound)
Firebase for a REST API
Bootstrap and a bit of Flexbox for the layout

It doesn't look exactly like the the real app, and it doesn't have all of the functionality that the real one does, but I hope that it's enough for my purposes.
